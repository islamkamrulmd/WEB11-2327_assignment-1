                “We are faced with famine in 1974 and people are dying of hunger.
                When people are dying of hunger, and you are a young economic
                teacher, teaching an elegant economic theory in the class room,
                it doesn't make you feel good. Because all your brilliant
                theories don't seem to, come into use of the people who dying.
                And it 's death you cannot explain because it's not cause of
                disease. ..it's just of not having food to eat...So in the situation
                like that you have nothing but frustration and agony. So one way,
                I try to kind of enlightened my frustration and agony by coming to
                the conclusion that I may not be useful as an economist, but I'm still
                a basic human being. I can juts go out and stand next to human being.
                And see if there's anything I can do to another person. Even for a day
                if it is help, pay for more a day, I feel more a little bit better.
                So that's why I started going outside the campus..I thought if you
                can become an angel for 27 dollars, it would be fun to do more of it ”
