                teacher, teaching an elegant economic theory in the class room,
                it doesn't make you feel good. Because all your brilliant

                And it 's death you cannot explain because it's not cause of
                disease. ..it's just of not having food to eat...So in the situation
                like that you have nothing but frustration and agony. So one way,
                I try to kind of enlightened my frustration and agony by coming to
                the conclusion that I may not be useful as an economist, but I'm still
                a basic human being. I can juts go out and stand next to human being.
                And see if there's anything I can do to another person. Even for a day
                if it is help, pay for more a day, I feel more a little bit better.
                So that's why I started going outside the campus..I thought if you

                        Bangladesh is undergoing a monumental transformation. After
                        more than 15 years under a regime marked by corruption,
                        oppression and exploitation, a courageous revolution led
                        by our students has ignited a new era. The fall of this
                        autocratic government has paved the way for an unprecedented
                        opportunity to rebuild our beloved nation under the interim
